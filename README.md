SQL Project: Data-Driven Growth Analysis for an E-Commerce Startup

As part of an advanced SQL course, I played the role of a Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce startup. My final project involved building a data-driven growth story for potential investors by leveraging MySQL to extract, analyze, and visualize key business metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Traffic & Channel Analysis â€“ Examined traffic sources, conversion rates, and user behaviors to identify high-performing marketing channels. 

ðŸ”¹ Product Performance â€“ Conducted product-level analysis, evaluating sales trends, cross-selling patterns, and refund rates.

ðŸ”¹ User Behavior Insights â€“ Segmented customers based on repeat sessions, lifetime value, and acquisition sources.

ðŸ”¹ Optimization Strategies â€“ Used time-series analysis and cohort tracking to identify revenue growth opportunities.

This project reinforced my ability to think like a data analyst, combining SQL expertise with business intelligence to drive strategic insights.
